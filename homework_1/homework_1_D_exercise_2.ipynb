Then rerun this notebook. To make sure you start afresh, you should also restart the kernel (so there are no old versions in memory). You can do this by going to `Kernel --> Restart Kernel...` and re-executing the notebook cells or selecting `Kernel --> Restart Kernel and Run All Cells`. Normally you would not redo all the model simulations every time, but since the simulations are short, we'll use that method for now."
